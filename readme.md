Startitecture.Core API
======================
The Startitecture Core API contains extension methods and classes common to typical development framework libraries. It is used as a core library in all [Startitecture](https://startitecture.com) projects, both public and private.

Vision
---
This API is intended to serve as a core utility library for Startitecture projects. Expansion of the library will be limited to implementation- and feature-agnostic classes and extension methods. This prevents it from becoming a "swiss-army" type utility module serving too many interests to maintain long-term.
